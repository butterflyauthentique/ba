# Firestore Database Setup Guide

## The Problem
You're getting `400 (Bad Request)` errors when trying to create products because the **Firestore database hasn't been created yet** in your Firebase project.

## Solution: Create Firestore Database

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Open your browser and go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Select your project: `butterflyauthentique33`

### Step 2: Create Firestore Database
1. In the left sidebar, click on **"Firestore Database"**
2. Click **"Create database"**
3. Choose **"Start in test mode"** (for development - you can secure it later)
4. Select a **location** (choose the closest to your users, e.g., `asia-south1` for India)
5. Click **"Done"**

### Step 3: Wait for Database to Initialize
- The database creation takes a few minutes
- You'll see a loading screen while it's being set up
- Once done, you'll see an empty Firestore database

### Step 4: Test the Connection
1. Go back to your admin panel: http://localhost:3003/admin/products/
2. Click the **"Test Firestore Connection"** button
3. You should see a success message
4. Check the browser console for detailed logs

### Step 5: Try Creating a Product
1. Go to: http://localhost:3003/admin/products/new/
2. Fill in the product details
3. Click "Save Product"
4. It should now work without the 400 errors!

## Alternative: Use the Setup Script

If you prefer, you can also run the setup script:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/pritinupur/ba_website

# Run the setup script
node scripts/setup-firestore.js
```

This script will:
- Test the Firestore connection
- Create sample collections and data
- Provide detailed error messages if something goes wrong

## Debugging

### Check Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file has all the required Firebase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=butterflyauthentique33.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=butterflyauthentique33
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=butterflyauthentique33.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

### Common Error Messages

1. **"Database not found"** - You need to create the Firestore database
2. **"Permission denied"** - Security rules are too restrictive (use test mode)
3. **"Service unavailable"** - Check your internet connection

### Browser Console Logs
The enhanced debugging will show detailed logs in the browser console:
- üîç Connection testing
- üöÄ Product creation process
- ‚úÖ Success messages
- ‚ùå Error details

## Security Rules (Later)
Once everything is working, you should update the Firestore security rules:

1. Go to Firestore Database in Firebase Console
2. Click on "Rules" tab
3. Replace the test rules with proper security rules
4. Example rules for development:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // For development only
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
After setting up Firestore:
1. ‚úÖ Create products in admin panel
2. ‚úÖ View products in admin panel
3. ‚úÖ Test the shop page
4. üîÑ Set up proper security rules
5. üîÑ Configure authentication
