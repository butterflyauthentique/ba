About artist Amol V. Nanal
Born 1977. Mumbai. India
B. F. A. (Applied Art)
Being in Bliss
This peaceful artist in India say “To understand Bliss… You don’t have to sit and do something but if you sit and do nothing you will become Blissful. Fitting moment of a wink that’s what it takes to understand what Buddha is, and that moment cannot be explained but only can be experienced”. No wonder why the paintings in India swirl in bliss when Amol fills his canvas with his soulful thoughts.

This Indian artist, Amol Nanal, also feels that to become meditative you don’t have to go anywhere out but you are coming back to your origin. Instead of just being on surface you are going deeper into the core to understand purpose of life, purpose of our existence. Just to touch that dimension you need to activate your body, mind, emotion and energy in a certain way to reach Nirvana.

As Gravity is constantly active…Grace is also constantly active. You just need to tune yourself inwards to receive that immense grace and ultimate wisdom.

My art is tribute to the World’s greatest spiritual master and World’s most Enduring Icon… that’s Buddha…

Be a part of my journey of Eternal Bliss…

This beautiful thought of Amol Nanal makes his paintings as  the best selling Buddha paintings today. Yes, he is the best seller of Buddha paintings today.

My Art
When I look deeper into my dimensions..I see that;

Every soul is in search of his own identity…just like me.

The mind space for which is too vast to gauge,
This is the first step inwards into the infinite

Transformation of thoughts into Beautiful Creations!
